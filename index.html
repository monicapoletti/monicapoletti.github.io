<p>My name is Monica. As an enthusiastic software engineer-in-training, I aim to make cool things that have impact. My strengths, interests, and experiences in software revolve primarily around artificial intelligence and include unmanned vehicle control, robotics, computer vision, and human-computer interaction. I'm a dreamer and a doer; right now I'm a student. With plans to graduate from North Carolina State University this May with degrees in both computer science and applied mathematics, I'm excited to take my education to a new level.</p>

<p>When I'm not working, I like to try new recipes, bike around Raleigh, or go to the rock climbing gym. When I get the chance to travel, I always make the most of it, which usually involves hunting down the best food and beer. If I'm anywhere with elevation, I'll probably be hiking or climbing to the best views or scared out of my mind on a mountain bike. I recently spent eight months working at a robotics company in Vermont where I learned to love snowy winters and skiing every other day, and I'm really excited for the time when I get to wear my Sorel Glacier boots again. Snow aside, I also enjoy spending time (the longer, the better) in California and the Southwest.</p>

<p>From January through August of 2014, I worked in Richmond, Vermont as a full-time intern at an underwater robotics company called Greensea Systems. <a href="https://twitter.com/GreenseaSystems">Greensea</a> designs products to help people easily and intuitively drive and operate their ROVs and AUVs from their computer rather than a joystick or control box. My job involved merging computer vision and sonar data to develop functional control features that rely solely on a single piece of sonar equipment, a very cost effective (and we found often more reliable) solution for underwater navigation.</p>

<p>Prior to Greensea, I worked on a research project at the Stanford University Department of Geophysics. My project involved writing programs to process <b>a lot</b> of seismic data (read: squiggles) to pick out small earthquakes that would normally go undetected by the human eye. These earthquakes, while not important and barely noticable in everyday life, occur more frequently and closer together than larger ones and have a lot to show about the structure of the earth and how it will change over time.</p>

<p>To see more details about these experiences and others, visit my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/monica-poletti/55/117/7aa/">LinkedIn profile</a> or ask to see my r&eacutesum&eacute. To talk about drones or electronic cars that drive themselves, see my contact information below.</p>

<p>If you would like (or are forced) to work and collaborate with me, see my calendar for my tentative availability. I'm an early riser with the help of a strong espresso, and I will stay up all night <b>iff</b> I have to. People are a priority; team meetings are a priority. Let's find a time to get together.</p>
