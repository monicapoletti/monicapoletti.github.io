      <p>It’s important for women to adventure outside together. You know how when you’re the only girl on the trip, you never really get to feel like you’re taking care of stuff? Sometimes that’s awesome, but sometimes you need a little dose of do-it-yourself. That’s why when my friend Nikki serendipitously tweeted that she had an open schedule and wanted to go play in the Rockies, I jumped at the chance for a girl trip.</p>

      <p>We met up in Denver to organize and pack. The timing couldn’t have been better for either of us&mdash;I was in the middle of my move from North Carolina to California; she had just moved from North Carolina to Colorado. I was living out of Joe Biden; she too was living out of her car, Joseph Smith (she says he has issues). Our shared status of complete and total bum made it easy for us to run off on nine days of hiking and camping from Utah to Montana. (Note: we did not hike from Utah to Montana. Nikki moved into JB, and the three of us slowly worked our way north together.)</p>

      <p>We kicked off Girl Trip with a drive to Moab. We stopped at the Mill Creek swimming holes for a morning dip and got an amazing breakfast at Eklecticafe. We then continued to Arches where we learned our planned hike down the lower Salt Wash would have to be postponed as a recent storm had completely flooded the whole area. Sad, but totally unsafe. We did a quick trip up to see the Delicate Arch, snapped the mandatory photo, then regrouped and decided to make the drive down to one of the most magical places in the world: Indian Creek! Open road, giant rocks, loose cattle, what more could you ask for? Well…we did ask for a little more. We pushed through to Canyonlands and spent two nights camping in the Needles. I got to test out my newest piece of desert-wear, the Outdoor Research Papyrus Brim hat. It was perfect for the sun, but Nikki did point out that with a muscle tee and my hair pulled back, I could pass for a young Puerto Rican kayaking guide named Luis. Win some, lose some.</p>

      <p>Two days wasn’t nearly enough time to take in the canyons (would eternity even be enough time?), but we ended our desert stint and started driving up to Jackson. We didn’t have solid plans for Wyoming, but we got out to Grand Teton National Park every day and, with some tips from the world’s coolest and most adorable ranger, Ryan, enjoyed some amazing weather, cool trails, and beautiful scenery. I was slightly let down that we didn’t see a single wild animal with the exception of one tiny garden snake. We did hear an elk bugle probably 10 feet away from our tent once, though, which almost counts. And we got to squeeze in a game of kickball with our super accommodating host, Chris, which was a hilariously entertaining bonus.</p>

      <p>After Jackson, we moseyed up to Missoula where I got to meet my long lost bro (not brother, bro) James, the son of my dad’s best friend from growing up. Missoula was lux compared to our last two stops. We slept indoors every night. We went to restaurants for our meals instead of eating dehydrated vegetarian chili mixed with Chex Mix (even worse than it sounds). We read books on the porch of James’s house. But we had fun exploring the nearby mountains and went mountain biking in Rattlesnake, so it was the perfect way to wind down without feeling too lazy. After a couple days, Nikki and I drove to Bozeman. We took in the Bridgers in the light of a glowing, cotton candy pink (Girl Trip!) sunset through JB’s bug-splattered windshield. We reminisced about our time in Utah, which at this point seemed like a year ago, to the sweet sounds of Drake’s Shot For Me.</p>

      <p>Nikki caught her flight back to Denver&mdash;on time, which is always a relief&mdash;and I made the drive back to James’s house just in time for a night cap with him and his roommates, officially bringing Girl Trip to a close.</p>
